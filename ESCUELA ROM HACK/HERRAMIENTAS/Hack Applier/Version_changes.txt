Version 1.1
	- become a tool! No more erasing everything to apply the latest feature.
	  Also, this adds a new level of customization, as it allows you to choose your
	  own variables, flags and table sizes. Positions are calculated by the in-tool
	  Free Space table.
   
	- Added Item scripts. Create items that execute scripts, so your scripts are as 
	  portable as they get.

	- In fact, more portable, with the key Input specials/hack. Allows you to block
	  on the source certain keys in-game, as well as force predefined key inputs
          and allow one script to be run with the press of a special button.
	
	- Trainer flag script, that are not wild battles.

	- Several specials added for the safari section, as well as allowing for over
	  25000 balls. Add and subtract balls, or set steps.

	- Created 5 new pedometers, with varied range and rate of activity.


Version 1.0 
	
	- repaired a bug in the OW adding, that made the new sprite look like the
	  old sprite at that position (table 0), as well as one that made one
	  sprite be treated as if it had the table 0 sprite size
	
	- added changing trainer picture on trainer's card.
	
	- added changing trainer backsprite
	
	- added dynamic switching Hero OW's at a specific place

	- created Dynamic OW's for a subsection of addresses (0xffyy)

	- added new type of scripting system, walking scripts
	
	- added party-affecting functions, such as status modifiers and pokemon
	  erasers

	- added one new function to the pokeDecrypt specials allowing to get
	  the PP for one specific move
	
	- added wild battle generators and tile getting functions

	- All previous changes are now solid enough to warrant this as a full
          version.

Version 0.2.1 (beta)
	
	- just some bug fixes:
		- the specific wild pokemon code wasn't completely functional,
		  because nintendo calculated the OTID at the end of the capture
		  function again. Now, on that case, it does not.
		  Also, until the pokemon is captured, the pokemon is still
		  capturable. if you don't want that, disable the code after it
		  was first found.
		
		- Nintendo never intended for the safari zone to run with 0 balls
		  As such having 0 balls would cause some problems:
			- Running would crash the game.
			- Throwing a ball would give you 255 balls. Now, throwing
			  one ball when you have none will make you throw a rock
			  instead.


Version 0.2 (beta)

	- repaired missing std commands (give item scripts)

	- Fixed small bug in the Swarm-Roam special and hack, now allowing for 
	  compatibility with the Wild data switch. 
	
	- Added to the Swarm-roam the capability to overwrite the level hack, 
	  allowing for Roaming pokemon (1 in 0x8006) to have a different level
	
	- Added three more slots to the Wild data switch, allowing you to replace
	  dynamically all of the 4 datas without the need to ovewrite the last
	  used one.
	
	- Sethealingplace command changed. now, it REQUIRES three variables to be
	  set in order to work

	- Forgot some specials in the previous version, now they're there
