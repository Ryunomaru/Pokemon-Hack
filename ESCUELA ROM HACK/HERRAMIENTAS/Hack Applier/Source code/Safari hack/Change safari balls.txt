/*Special 0x87 is a increase\decrease safari balls code. It's use is to make it easier
to change the number of safari balls the player has.
uses 0x8004 as the number to increase or decrease the balls by. 0x1aa decreases the 
balls by aa, and 0x0aa increases them by aa. This code doesn't allow people to go over
the 100 (0x64) max balls in aa (safety measure).*/
