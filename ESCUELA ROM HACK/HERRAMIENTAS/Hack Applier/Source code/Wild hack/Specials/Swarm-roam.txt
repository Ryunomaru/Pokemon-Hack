/*Special 0x56 makes a chance that a pokemon other than the 
normal kind appears.
var 0x8004 tells the pokemon number
var 0x8005 tells the chances of appearence
var 0x8006 tells if it's one of a kind
chances is the number of times that a pokemon
would appear in 65536 encounters. 0 is the lowest
and 0xffff is always. 0x7fff is the 50% chance it
will be the designed pokemon.
var 0x8007 keeps the place the pokemon is to appear on
0x8006 is 0, pokemon will appear indefinetly
0x8006 > 1, pokemon will appear that number of times
0x8004 key:
0 -> 0x3fff: faced as pokemon number
0x4000-> 0x8015: faced as pokemon number IN variable
0x8000-> 0xfffc: not defined
0xfffd-> specific pokemon stored at a pointer kept in 
	 two variables 0x8008 0x8009
	 eg: 0x08800100 would be stored 0100 in 0x8008 and
	 0880 in 0x8009
0xfffe-> specific pokemon stored at a pointer, that must be 
	 placed by hand in 0x0203f488
0xffff-> specific pokemon stored at the LoadPointer location
0x8007 key:(by bit) (0 is still all)
0 -> grass only
1 -> water only
2 -> rocksmash\tree event only
3 -> fishing rod only
8-16 -> pokemon level
