/*this code loads a key to check for, and sets a script to execute if it's in the OW map
and no scripts are loaded yet. Use together with the ignore key special for the best 
results (ex: disable R and set this to react to R button)
Because the code is run before any other of the key ones, this one detects the real keys
pressed.

Special cb receives:
0x8004 is the keys to check for
loaded with loadpointer 0x0 is the script to use
returns nothing

There is no clear code. If you want the game to ignore the script, you need to use
this code with 0x0 on 0x8004.
