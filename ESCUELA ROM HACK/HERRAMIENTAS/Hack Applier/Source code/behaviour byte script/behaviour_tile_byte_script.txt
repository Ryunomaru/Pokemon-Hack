/*this code is meant to substitute the memory-filling, inefficient and 
unexpansible GameFreaks behaviourbyte+surf scripts. this code is the one
responsible for when you click A in front of a tile, the tile doing something.
This code enables all tiles to have a default script, even grass. Because of the
new workings of this function, some scripts need to be changed:
TV screen will now work sideways, to fix add a checkfacing
Same thing with the town map
Surf will not ask you for the badge.
Same thing with Waterfall. just add a checkflag to them, that's what the old code
did anyway.*/
